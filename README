This is a source service for Open Build Service.
It allows users to generate a set of services based
simple templates with positional parameters.

One intended purpose is to provide a way to
systematically generate spec files for a package
with multiple builds.  Embedding the logic
in a service file allows the spec files to be generated
by a WebHook trigger from the SCM.
